## Hi, I'm Ben

I'm currently working as an AI Engineer. I studied biomedical engineering at Duke, got accepted to medical school, and chose to pause those ambitions to pursue AI at Stanford. 

I'm currently working at **NVIDIA** on AI applications.

At Stanford, I researched AI and neuromuscular biomechanics, exploring how we can use machine learning to understand human movement and health.

Before joining NVIDIA, I worked at **Apple** on health technologies and spent time at various startups building moonshot projects in the health space.

In a past life, I was a percussion nerd. I studied at Tanglewood and Juilliard and spent my Duke years equally passionate about biomedical engineering and music (and Duke basketball).

I'm fascinated by the intersection of AI and human health. I volunteer in hospitals, mentor others, and think deeply about how technology can make healthcare more human.

The decision between medical school and AI was one of deep reflection. I chose to work on problems at the edge of AI and biology for now.

I'm best reached via [email](mailto:benrandoing@gmail.com). I'm always open to interesting conversations about AI, healthcare, and building things that matter.
